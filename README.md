# Rotary Encoder

#### Project Overview

The Rotary Encoder project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Nano to read the rotation direction of a rotary encoder. Rotary encoders are input devices that convert the angular position or rotation of a shaft into digital signals. This project interprets the signals from the rotary encoder and prints the rotation direction to the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Rotary Encoder**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Rotary Encoder to Arduino Nano:**
   - **CLK Pin:** Connect to digital pin 2 (D2) on the Arduino Nano.
   - **DT Pin:** Connect to digital pin 3 (D3) on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the rotary encoder to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - Rotate the encoder clockwise and counter-clockwise.
   - The serial monitor will display the rotation direction.

#### Applications

- **User Input Control:** Use rotary encoders as input devices for controlling parameters such as volume, menu selection, and scrolling in various electronic projects.
- **Interface Design:** Implement rotary encoders as user interface elements for navigating menus and adjusting settings in devices.
- **Position Sensing:** Utilize rotary encoders for position sensing applications in robotics and automation.

#### Notes

- Ensure the rotary encoder is securely attached and correctly wired to the Arduino Nano.
- Adjust the `CLK` and `DT` pin assignments in the code if you connect the rotary encoder to different digital pins.
- Experiment with different types of rotary encoders to suit the specific requirements of your project.
